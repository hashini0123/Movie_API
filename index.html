                    <h3>The Secret Agent</h3>
                    <p>Once in a while, you see a movie that doesn't feel made, but
                        extracted from a dreaming mind. It has a strong personality
                        and visual style and moves to its own mysterious rhythms.
                        It won't go to you and hand over its meanings. You have to
                        go to it. That's "The Secret Agent," written and directed
                        by Kleber Mendonça Filho ("Aquarius," "Bacarau"). 
                        Set in 1977 Brazil, roughly at the midpoint of
                        a 21-year military dictatorship, "The Secret Agent"
                        is a drama, a satire, an intriguingly laid-back espionage
                        film, and a recreation of a time and place, with
                        expressionistic and surreal flourishes that must be
                        accepted on their own terms. Wagner Moura stars as Marcelo,
                        a tall, bearded fellow with gentle energy and sad eyes. He
                        arrives in Recife, the state capital of Pernambuco, Brazil, in a
                        bright yellow Volkswagen Beetle. We don't know why he's come to Recife.
                        We won't know for a long time. You have to pick up on subtext in order
                        to understand certain conversations. Marcelo and the other
                        characters in his orbit try to avoid saying exactly what they
                        mean, because someone might be listening.</p>
